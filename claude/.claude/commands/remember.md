Review the session transcript and update CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/` with any important learnings, preferences, or patterns discovered during this session.

**Where to add:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - High-level project overview, architecture, primary commands
- `.claude/rules/<topic>.md` - Specific conventions and patterns (testing, dialogs, api, etc.)

**What to capture:**
- New conventions or patterns established
- User preferences discovered
- Useful commands or workflows
- Project-specific knowledge gained

Be concise. Only add genuinely useful learnings, not obvious things.
